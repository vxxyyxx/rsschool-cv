### Briefly about myself
I began my career as a specialist in International Trade, advancing to the position of Head of the Foreign Sales Bureau at a Ferro-Concrete Plant, a role I currently hold. 

My strongest traits include high responsibility, attention to detail, and excellent communication skills. In my role, I am often involved in resolving conflicts, creating and executing sales plans, and managing my team effectively.

Over the past year, I developed a strong interest in programming. I initially explored Python, but after careful consideration, I decided to focus on becoming a Frontend Developer. I find the learning process fascinating and am excited to enhance my Web Development skills day by day.
